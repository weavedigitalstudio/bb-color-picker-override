# Beaver Builder Colour Picker Presets Override

Simple single use plugin which uses JS to override Beaver Builder's colour picker behaviour making your colour presets visible first by default instead of just the picker, streamlining your development workflow. 

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it! No configuration needed.

## How It Works

When you click any colour picker in Beaver Builder, the plugin automatically shows the presets panel instead of requiring you to click the show presets button first.

- WordPress
- Beaver Builder
